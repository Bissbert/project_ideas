# JavaFX Regex Tool

The Java Regex Tool should be a simple Regex creation and Valdation tool.

This means the tool mainly consists of 2 parts.
The first being the Regex field and the second the content to be tested by the Regex.

## Design

The design of the tool should be modified to have round corners and modern flair by ustilising a slighly transperant background which has both a dark mode and a ligh mode.

### Main Window

The main window will consist of 2 field which are separated only by a line.
The upper window, which contains the Regex is about 1/4 of the screen and has a button for a Regex refrence<sup>[*](#regex-reference)</sup>. 
The lower part is filled with a textarea which can be filled with the text to be checked. On top of this field the markers will then be placed.

### Regex Reference

This Reference may either be a Link to an online source or a side pupout which will contain the reference.
